<b>Clothing store W&S (Wardrobe&Style) is my imaginary business idea with plenty of real-life data application.</b>

I have created the database and its schema on my own, without supporting myself with online resources. That's why this project has a characteristic of a trial-and-error which I deliberately left to be seen in the code.

<b>Database used:</b> Oracle (important, since the code may not run 100% properly on other databases).
